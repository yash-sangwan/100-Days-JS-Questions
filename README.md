## Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language that is essential for web development. This repository aims to provide a structured and engaging way to practice JavaScript by solving one question per day for 100 days. Each question is designed to help you learn new concepts, reinforce your understanding, and improve your problem-solving skills.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 100 Days of JavaScript Questions, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yash-sangwan/100-Days-JS-Questions.git
   cd 100-Days-JS-Questions
   ```

2. **Explore the Questions:**
   Navigate to the `questions` directory to find the daily questions. Each question is in a separate file named `dayXX.md` where `XX` is the day number.

3. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   Ensure you have a working environment for running JavaScript code. You can use a code editor like VSCode, Sublime Text, or any other editor of your choice.

## Daily Questions

The questions are organized in a sequential manner, with each day presenting a new challenge. The questions cover various topics including:

- Basic Syntax
- Functions and Scope
- Arrays and Objects
- Promises and Asynchronous JavaScript
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Handling
- ES6+ Features
- And more...

Each question file includes the problem statement, examples, and hints to help you get started. Some questions may also include additional resources for further reading.

## How to Use

1. **Read the Question:**
   Open the file for the current day (e.g., `day01.md`) and read the problem statement carefully.

3. **Solve the Problem:**
   Write your solution in a separate JavaScript file or directly in your preferred code editor.

4. **Test Your Solution:**
   Run your code to ensure it works as expected. You can use the browser console, Node.js, or any JavaScript runtime environment.

5. **Check the Solution:**
   Compare your solution with the provided solution (if available) to understand different approaches and optimize your code.

6. **Move to the Next Day:**
   Once you are satisfied with your solution, move on to the next day's question and repeat the process.
